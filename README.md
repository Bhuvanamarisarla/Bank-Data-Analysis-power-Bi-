BANK DATA ANALYSIS 

Developed and executed a  project on Bank data Analysis by using a power bi. In this Project, a meticulous exploration of financial data was conducted using power bi focusing on various key performance indicators (KPIs).All the extracting, cleaning and Transformation of the data took place in the power query. This bank has 39.72k consumers with a loan amount of 445.6M 

We have used slicers, page navigation, bookmarks, drill through options in order to make the project more dynamic.

This project involved year-wise analysis of loan amounts, detailed statistics on loan grades and sub-grades regarding revolving balances and total payments. A critical comparison between verified and non-verified loan statuses was made, examining total payments for each. State-wise and last credit pull-wise loan status evaluations were performed, offering a nuanced understanding of regional and temporal trends. Additionally, the project delved into the relationship between home ownership and last payment date statistics.The culmination of these analyses resulted in the creation of a dynamic dashboard, consolidating all KPIs. 

INSIGHTS

KPI - 1 : YEAR WISE LOAN AMOUNT STATS
For this kpi we have used a line chart to understand year wise data easily, we analysed that the trend in loan amounts increased over the years i.e from 2007 to 20011.

KPI - 2 : GRADE AND SUBGRADE WISE REVOLVING BALANCE 
For this kpi we have used a vertical bar chart to analyse revolving balance by grade and sub grade and we have found that grade "B" and sub grade "B 3" has the highest revolving balance as compared to the other grades.

KPI - 3 : TOTAL PAYMENT FOR VERIFIED AND NON VERIFIED STATUS.
We have used a pie chart to analyse two different fields of verified and non-verified status we have analysed that 41% of customers have not verified their payment method. 

KPI - 4 : STATE WISE LAST CREDIT PULL DATE
In this kpi we have used a table visualisation in order to show the last credit pull date to the respective State.

KPI - 5 : HOME OWNERSHIP vs LAST PAYMENT DATE
For this kpi we have used a bar chart and we analysed by comparing the last payment Dates for borrowers with different home ownership status 

CONCLUSION :
This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for decision-makers within the banking sector, offering actionable insights for strategic planning, risk assessment, and operational enhancements. The use of power bi's robust features facilitated a detailed examination of the data, empowering stakeholders with a clear visualization of the bank's performance metrics.
